My research operates in a dynamic circle that connects theory, methods, and applications. I focus on developing statistical inference methods for multivariate extremes through copula and extreme value theory (EVT), to address the challenges in risk management across finance, insurance, and environmental science.

The three main themes of my current research are

- #### Theoretical studies on copula and extreme value theory
  
    <!-- Amid the growing demand for statistical methods to handle high-dimensional and complex datasets, the inference of extreme values presents unique challenges. In contrast to typical big data scenarios, extreme values are inherently rare.
    Thus, the focus of \textbf{extreme value inference} is on extrapolation instead of interpolation.
    A major theme of my research is to develop theoretically justified frameworks and statistical estimation methods that enable reliable extrapolation from observed data to unobserved extremes. -->

- #### Methodological improvements for modeling high-dimensional extremes
  
- #### Systemic risk management for industrial applications
