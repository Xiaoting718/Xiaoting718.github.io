- Summer 2024: [Introduction to Probability](https://coda.io/@xiaoting-li/stat-302-teaching-hub) (STAT 302)
  
    The course website shares all the material I created for STAT 302, including the course notes, lecture slides and many practice problems with detailed solution keys. It provides good study material for anyone seeking a gentle introduction to probability theory.
