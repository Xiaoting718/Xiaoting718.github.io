## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at the University of British Columbia, working under the supervision of [Dr. Harry Joe](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~harry/){:target="_blank"}. I am supported by NSERC Doctoral Scholarship to conduct reserach on multivariate extreme inference. I received a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Joint Honours Economics and Finance from McGill University, where I graduated with the prestigious Allen Oliver Gold Medal. Driven by strong interests in quantitative research, I pursued graduate studies in Statistics under the supervision of [Dr. Christian Genest](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/cgenest/){:target="_blank"}, who guided my early research on statistical modeling of clustered extremes. During my Ph.D. studies, I have focused on the more challenging problems posed by multivariate extremes.
