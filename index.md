## About Me

I joined the Department of Statistics at the University of Manitoba as an Assistant Professor in July 2025. Prior to that, I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of British Columbia, where I was fortunate to work under the supervision of [Dr. Harry Joe](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~harry/){:target="_blank"}. My doctoral research, supported by an NSERC Doctoral Scholarship, focused on statistical inference for multivariate extremes with applications to systemic risk analysis.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Joint Honours Economics and Finance from McGill University, where I was awarded the prestigious Allen Oliver Gold Medal. Motivated by a strong interest in quantitative research, I pursued graduate studies in Statistics under the mentorship of [Dr. Christian Genest](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/cgenest/){:target="_blank"}, who introduced me to the theory of copulas and extremes and guided my early research.

My current reseach focus on

- Copula dependence modelling
- Extreme value theory
- Graphical models for extremes
- Systemic risk in finance, insurance and environmental science
